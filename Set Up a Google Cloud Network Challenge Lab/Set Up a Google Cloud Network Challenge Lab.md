## Solution [here]()

### Task 1: Migrate a stand-alone PostgreSQL database to a Cloud SQL for PostgreSQL instance

Task 1: Migrate a stand-alone PostgreSQL database to a Cloud SQL for PostgreSQL instance

1. Enable the [Database Migration API](https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/product/google/datamigration.googleapis.com) and the [Service Networking API](https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/product/google/servicenetworking.googleapis.com)

2. Go to [VM instances](https://console.cloud.google.com/compute/instances)

3. Click `SSH` next to `antern-postgresql-vm`

### Run the following Commands in `SSH`

```
sudo apt install postgresql-13-pglogical
```
```
sudo su - postgres -c "gsutil cp gs://cloud-training/gsp918/pg_hba_append.conf ."
sudo su - postgres -c "gsutil cp gs://cloud-training/gsp918/postgresql_append.conf ."
sudo su - postgres -c "cat pg_hba_append.conf >> /etc/postgresql/13/main/pg_hba.conf"
sudo su - postgres -c "cat postgresql_append.conf >> /etc/postgresql/13/main/postgresql.conf"
sudo systemctl restart postgresql@13-main
```
```
sudo su - postgres
psql
```
```
\c postgres;
CREATE EXTENSION pglogical;
\c orders;
CREATE EXTENSION pglogical;
\c gmemegen_db;
CREATE EXTENSION pglogical;
```

Go to [CREATE MIGRATION JOB](https://console.cloud.google.com/dbmigration/migrations/create)

* NOW FOLLOW VIDEO INSTRUCTIONS

### Task 2: Update permissions and add IAM roles to users

Go to [IAM](https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/iam) and follow video instructions

### Task 3: Create networks and firewalls

* Note: For this task, you will need to log in to the `Cymbal Project` with the `Cymbal Owner credentials`.

### Run the following Commands in CloudShell

### Assign Veriables
```
export VPC_NAME=
export SUBNET_A=
export REGION_A=
export SUBNET_B=
export REGION_B=
export FIREWALL_RULE_NAME_1=
export FIREWALL_RULE_NAME_2=
export FIREWALL_RULE_NAME_3=
```
```
